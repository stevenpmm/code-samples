THe enclosed 5 scripts form part of the software behind the holiday web site http://www.greeksun.co.uk/

THey are in a nested folder structure taken directly from the original project. 

Specifically these scripts control this page .... http://www.greeksun.co.uk/resort-view/
and make use of a bespoke MVC pattern.

When the page is loaded, a controller called 'resort-view' (file controller.php, line 46) is invoked that will 
contain the necessary business logic to ...

1. capture data through a model (file model.php)
2. pass the data to a view, and (file view.php)
3. render the html in the browser 

An ajax function is also included that is called within 'Refine Results' at the top of the web page

Note: in the left panel 'Holiday Search' is the same as 'Refine Results'.


I have annotated the scripts and so the flow of events should be clear. Start with the controller.

If you need further clarification don't hesitate to contact me,

regards,

Steven Matthews
